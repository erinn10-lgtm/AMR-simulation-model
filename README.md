# AMR-simulation-model
The ARON model is an agent-based model that simulates the infection dynamics of (non-)resistant infections in a community setting. It accounts for individual heterogeneity by incorporating factors such as age and gender, which influence infection risk. Infection probabilities are dynamically adjusted based on the proportion of infected individuals in the population. The model simulates infection progression, immune response, and the emergence of resistance over time, providing insights into the interplay between antibiotic consumption and pathogen spread.
Focused on AMR development in a community setting, the model uses data from primary care settings. It also incorporates demographic dynamics, including population changes such as births and deaths, to reflect long-term trends and ensure a realistic representation of the community setting. Going beyond a purely biomedical focus, the model remains human-centred, emphasizing environmental factors that influence AMR (e.g., antibiotic pressure in the environment). Its primary goal is to estimate monthly AMR levels in both the control and intervention group, providing a comprehensive understanding of the intervention's impact.
